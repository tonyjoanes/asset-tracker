# Asset Tracker, Architecture and API

## Disclaimer

This is a sample application and code used for the purposes of **Tony Joanes** learning more about *microservices* and creating an example of his understanding around the architecture, design and implementation of a *microservices* solution.

## 1. Introduction and Goals

**Personal Goals** are to have some fun with *microservices* and to do some learning and demonstration of my skills. Asset Tracker is a domain I am familiar with from experience at multiple organisations and have learned the *pros* and *cons* and want to try things out in my own way and at the same to demonstrating my software architecture and design skills.

> Although I have worked at organisation that have a similar domain I am completely using alternative methods in regards to technology and processes and a different architectural approach

**Solution Goals** I aim to demonstrate a near production ready application that in theory could be used as intended.

### 1.1 Requirements Overview

#### What is Asset Tracker

Asset Tracker is an application to provide an organisation the ability to track assets in terms of where they are located, what tests or work needs to be carried out on them (PAT, Calibration for example).

#### Main features

- Tracking your customers
- Tracking your customer contacts
- Tracking any customers asset
  - Status
  - Location
  - Testing Schedules
- Creating a testing schedule for an asset which can be assigned to a user
- Assigning a test schedule to a user
- Tracking test schedules status (pass/fail/retest/unable to test)

### 1.2 Quality Goals

| #    | Quality           | Motivation                                                   |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Understandability | A simple domain that can be made as complex as you like once it evolves. This allows me to focus on the technology choices being used |
| 2    | Efficiency        | Being able to have an overview of a customer assets, where they are and what maintenance needs to be carried out on them |
| 3    | Interoperability  | New clients can be created and make use of the API's that are created |
| 4    | Testability       | Each building block of the architecture should be testable   |
